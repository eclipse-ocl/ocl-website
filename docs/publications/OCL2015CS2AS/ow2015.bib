  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a high level view of technological spaces
	(TS) and relations among these spaces. A technological space is a
	working context with a set of associated concepts, body of knowledge,
	tools, required skills, and possibilities. It is often associated
	to a given user community with shared know-how, educational support,
	common literature and even workshop and conference regular meetings.
	Although it is difficult to give a precise definition, some TSs can
	be easily identified, e.g. the XML TS, the DBMS TS, the abstract
	syntax TS, the meta-model (OMG/MDA) TS, etc. The purpose of our work
	is not to define an abstract theory of technological spaces, but
	to figure out how to work more efficiently by using the best possibilities
	of each technology. To do so, we need a basic understanding of the
	similarities and differences between various TSs, and also of the
	possible operational bridges that will allow transferring the results
	obtained in one TS to other TS. We hope that the presented industrial
	vision may help us putting forward the idea that there could be more
	cooperation than competition among alternative technologies. Furthermore,
	as the spectrum of such available technologies is rapidly broadening,
	the necessity to offer clear guidelines when choosing practical solutions
	to engineering problems is becoming a must, not only for teachers
	but for project leaders as well.},
